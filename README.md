# bigsix

This is a python implementation of a simple hydrological model allowing calculations of water balance of six dams that supply Cape Town in water. The repo also contains data enabling those calculations.
The model and data are the basis of the Big Six monitor website (cip.csag.uct.ac.ca/monitoring/bigsix.html). They were developed during the so-called "Day Zero" drought - the drought that affected Cape Town in 2015-2017 - with the aim of increasing public understanding of hydrological and climate dynamics underlying that event.
